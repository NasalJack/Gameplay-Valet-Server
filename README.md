# Gameplay Valet Server

Gameplay Valet is a repository of information about various boardgames. User should be able to access rules and tips for each game as a visitor or create an account to be able to curate a smaller list of only the games they own/play as well as being able to write notes for any game that will be stored for later reference.

The deployed app can be found at: https://gampeplayvalet.now.sh/
